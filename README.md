# Student-Result-Analysis
-This project focuses on analyzing students’ academic performance using data analysis and visualization techniques. By examining students’ scores in different subjects along with demographic factors, the project aims to identify patterns and trends that influence academic outcomes.

---

## Objectives
- To study the impact of parents’ education level on students’ academic performance.
- To analyze the distribution of students across different ethnic groups.
- To understand the variation in scores for Math, Reading, and Writing subjects.
- To represent insights using effective data visualization techniques.

## Result
From the analysis, it is observed that students whose parents have higher educational qualifications generally perform better in academic subjects. The heatmap clearly indicates a positive relationship between parents’ education and students’ scores. The ethnic group distribution provides insight into the representation of different groups within the dataset.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization techniques can be used to understand student performance effectively. Visual tools such as pie charts, heatmaps, and box plots make it easier to interpret complex data. The study concludes that parents’ education has a positive impact on students’ academic performance, and data visualization plays a crucial role in deriving meaningful insights.
